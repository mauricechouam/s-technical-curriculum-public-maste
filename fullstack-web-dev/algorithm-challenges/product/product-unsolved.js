/*
Given an array of integers, write a function that calculates the 
product of all integers other than the number at index.

For example, input:

  [7, 12, 8, 9]

your function would return:

  [ 864, 504, 756, 672]

by calculating:

  [12*8*9, 7*8*9, 7*12*9, 7*12*8]


The solution must execute in O(n^2) time. (HINT: you'll want a nested loop!)
Do not use division in your solution. 
*/

function calculateProduct(arr) {
    // your code here
}

console.log(calculateProduct([7, 12, 8, 9]));
