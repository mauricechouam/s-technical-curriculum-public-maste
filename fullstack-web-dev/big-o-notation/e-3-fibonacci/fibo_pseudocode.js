// initialize variables, "a" as 1, "b" as 0 to check for numbers that don't have
// previous values to add up 

// initialize a temporary holder variable to store temp value

// using a while loop to execute the required logic only if the number 
// is greater than 0
    
// set the temporary variable to "a", which starts at 1

// redefine a to equal the total of a and b

// set b to equal whatever is stored in the temporary variable

// reduce num by 1 digit, this will then repeat until num is 0

// if num is not greater than 0, return b immediately, or return b after
// the while loop has executed

// execute the function
